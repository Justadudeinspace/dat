# About DAT - Dev Audit Tool

**DAT (Dev Audit Tool)** is an enterprise-grade, cross-platform security and compliance scanning engine built for complete project visibility and security auditing.

Created by **~JADIS | Justadudeinspace**, DAT provides comprehensive security scanning, compliance validation, and code quality analysis through a single command. It delivers complete project visibility: every file, every vulnerability, every compliance issue, and every insight — from source code to configuration files and documentation.

DAT is built for **security-conscious developers and enterprises**, those who need clarity across complexity — whether you're auditing a massive monorepo, ensuring compliance in regulated environments, or maintaining code quality across distributed teams.

## 🎯 Philosophy

> "To see the system is to understand it.  
> To understand it is to secure it.  
> To secure it is to empower it."  
> — ~JADIS

The intent behind DAT isn't just inspection — it's **security enlightenment**.  
It's for security engineers, compliance officers, and architects who want to understand how their ecosystems *breathe* while ensuring they're protected and compliant.
