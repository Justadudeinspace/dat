# About `dat`

**Dev Audit Tool (dat)** is a cross-platform developer utility built for total project visibility.

Created by **~JADIS | Justadudeinspace**, `dat` provides a one-command way to *see everything*: every file, every line, every byte, and every insight — from code to documentation, and even media assets.

`dat` is built for **big-picture developers**, those who need clarity across complexity — whether you're auditing a massive monorepo or tracing your own creative journey through source and structure.

### Philosophy

> "To see the system is to understand it.  
> To understand it is to harmonize it."  
> — ~JADIS

The intent behind `dat` isn’t just inspection — it’s illumination.  
It’s for architects, auditors, and creators who want to understand how their ecosystems *breathe*.

### Core Tenets

- **Cross-Platform:** works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Termux.
- **Extendable:** plug-in architecture with configurable extensions.
- **Safe Defaults:** never deletes or overwrites files.
- **Readable Reports:** clear summaries for insight at a glance.
